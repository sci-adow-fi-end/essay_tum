Maintaining foundamental propreties of important documents, like secrecy and autenticity, through the process of digitalization has been one of
the main quests of the last decades.
These qualities have been currenty achieved mainly by the routh of cleaver mathematics, exploiting proprietis of our current computing machines and
expecially the knowledge, although not cristal clear, of what they can or can't do in a reasonable time.
These tecniques that are omnipresent today could be no longer valid when new computing machines based on different physical principles become more capable.
In fact, although quantum computers are equally capable as classical computers in terms of what they can compute, they probably can compute some
foundamental problems more quickly and this feature of them can be used to break our current secure information systems.
Quantum computers are surely promising in that regards but their capabilities are limited both by theorical boundaries and pratical issues.
The biggest of these issues that limits, at least for now, how their computing power can grow is the interaction between qubits and the external world.
Quantum algorithms are in fact probabilistic algorithms that work by maximizing the probability of measuring the state corresponding to the solution and
these interaction tend to flatten the distribution of the possible measurements.
